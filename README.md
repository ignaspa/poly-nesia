# POLY-NESIA

### General Summary
This is a project I undertook with Jonah Simpson (jonahs99) to learn
some image manipulation. We had several primary objectives...

1) synthetically blur an image
2) select areas within an image and cut them out
3) transform an image into a more primitive polygon composite, ie poly art

We have successfully implemented such processes.

### Examples
