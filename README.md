# poly-nesia
Project undertaken with Jonah Simpson to learn some image manipulation as well
as create effects. Currently we have successfully implemented Gaussian blurring
and shape selection tool. Our current goal is to have an easy process
which takes an image, allows the user to select a shape within it, and returns
an image with the background blurred and the selected area as a bunch of
basic triangles with average colors (poly art).
